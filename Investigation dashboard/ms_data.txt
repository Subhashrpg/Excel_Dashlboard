Client/Policy Insights

What is the count of claims filed by each insurer?
How many cases were processed for each type of policy (e.g., Group, Retail)?
What is the distribution of cases across clients (e.g., Medi Assist)?
What is the total IO Cost per client or insurer?

Case Performance Analysis

What is the average TAT (Turnaround Time) across different types of cases?
How many cases fall into each TAT category (e.g., 0-7 days, 15-30 days)?
What is the percentage of positive vs. negative cases for each SPOC (Single Point of Contact)?
What is the verification status breakdown (Positive/Negative)?

Geographical Analysis

Which cities or states have the highest number of claims filed?
What is the state-wise or city-wise distribution of hospitals involved in cases?
What are the top-performing IOs in each city or state?

Hospital/IO Analysis

Which hospitals have handled the highest number of cases?
What is the average IO cost incurred per hospital?
Which IO has managed the most cases overall or within a specific category (Network vs. Non-Network)?
What are the stages of patients at different hospitals (e.g., Patient - Stage)?

Financial Insights

What is the total cost distribution (IO Cost + Extra Cost) per case type?
What is the distribution of MRD fees across different cases?
How does Total IO Cost vary for Network vs. Non-Network hospitals?

Time-Based Analysis

How many cases were initiated and closed each month?
What is the trend in case closures over time (weekly/monthly)?
What is the average case processing time (Case Initiation to Closure)?

Other Analytical Opportunities

What are the adjusted and unadjusted aging distributions?
Which hospitals/IOs contribute to the highest adjusted aging cases?
How does "Hospital Stage" affect the case outcomes?


Data Cleaning: will verify data quality, handle missing values, and normalize columns as necessary.
Data Transformation: Aggregate and group data for analysis.
Key Metrics Selection: Focus on metrics for KPIs (e.g., TAT, cost, case closure trends).
Dashboard Layout: Define the sections and visuals (charts, slicers, etc.) for the dashboard.
Chart Creation: Build visuals like pivot charts, bar graphs, heat maps, and timelines.
